## OpenPAI deploy on AKS

The purpose of this document is to enable users to deploy OpenPAI on a cluster of Azure AKS.

### 1. Prepare or adapt an AKS cluster for OpenPAI precautions<a name="a-step-1"></a>



There are two situations in which a user's AKS cluster can be ***[built from scratch]((https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/kubernetes-walkthrough#create-aks-cluster))*** and ***existing clusters***. For clusters in different situations, we summarized some ***Precautions*** (affect the service function being deployed) and ***Recommended considerations*** before and during deployment.

***Precautions***:
- For api-server RBAC: 
  - When deploy AKS from scratch: Disable api-server RBAC when create cluster by param ["--disable-rbac"](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/aks?view=azure-cli-latest#az-aks-create). 
  -  When use existing enabled RBAC AKS cluster: OpenPAI service pod will be mounted default service account. User could [create role binding refer aks doc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/kubernetes-dashboard#for-rbac-enabled-clusters) to"default:default" [service account](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#service-account-permissions) and "kube-system:k8s-dashboard" service account. As OpenPAI service restserver / prometheus etc & k8s dashboard will access api-server.

***Recommended considerations***:
- For node disk: 
  - When deploy AKS from scratch: Use the ***az aks create*** command to create an AKS cluster. Configure the node os disk through the configuration item ***--node-osdisk-size to*** have large disk space. It is better > 500GB. 
  - When user existing AKS cluster: If the disk is small, the user can mount a larger disk through the AKS VM and change the disk path "data-path: "/datastorage" item in service-configuration.yaml used by the PAI service to a larger disk in step-3 below.

### Step 1. Prepare Deployment Environment <a name="c-step-1"></a>

- Step 1.1. [A guide to prepare deployment env](./prepare_dev_env.md)

- Step 1.2. Prepare kubectl for AKS env 

- [install Azure CLI doc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-apt?view=azure-cli-latest).
 
- [config kubectl](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/kubernetes-walkthrough#connect-to-the-cluster)

To manage a Kubernetes cluster, you use kubectl, the Kubernetes command-line client. If you use Azure Cloud Shell, kubectl is already installed. To install kubectl locally, use the az aks install-cli command:
```
az aks install-cli
```

To configure kubectl to connect to your Kubernetes cluster, use the az aks get-credentials command. This command downloads credentials and configures the Kubernetes CLI to use them. User could get "myResourceGroup", "myAKSCluster" from your Azure portal or Azure CLI.

```
az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster
```

output logs:

Merged "myAKSCluster" as current context in /root/.kube/config

### Step 2. Prepare Configuraiton <a name="c-step-2"></a>

- [A guide to generate layout](./generate_layout.md)

***

### Step 3. Update cluster configuration into kubernetes <a name="c-step-3"></a>

- [A guide to update configuration](./push-cfg-and-set-id.md)

***

### Step 4. Start all OpenPAI services <a name="c-step-4"></a>

- [A guide to start OpenPAI services](./how-to-start-pai-serv.md)


***

### Other considerations and configurations <a name="c-step-5"></a>

- Expose OpenPAI mainpage 

Admin could open the OpenPAI homepage to the external network users through [Azure load balancer and service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/static-ip). Redirect public ip to port 80 (default is OpenPAI entry page default 80 port)

For [this step](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/static-ip#create-a-service-using-the-static-ip-address): update k8s service load balancer yaml config to use app: pylon as selector.

```
spec:
  selector:
    app: pylon
```

- OpenPAI master use GPU node

Normally we recommend use the cpu node to deploy the Open master. But AKS [Multi node pooling functionality is not yet supported](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/914020-azure-kubernetes-service-aks/suggestions/34917127-support-multiple-node-pool). The default OpenPAI on AKS will use the GPU node as the master. The master node will not schedule jobs, and the master node GPU will not be used.
